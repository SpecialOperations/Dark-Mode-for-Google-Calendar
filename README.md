The only true OLED Dark Mode for Google Calendar. 

**How to install:**

1. Install the [Stylus extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en-GB "Stylus extension") from the Chrome store.
2. Install straight from Github [here](https://github.com/SpecialOperations/Dark-Mode-for-Google-Calendar/raw/main/OLED-darkmode.user.css). *Supports automatic updates!*
3. Done!

Important note!

Ever since I graduated college in spring, I haven't been using Google Calendar much since transitioning to Outlook at my new work place. (Boooo) Hence why this style hasn't been updated in almost 6 months. The only reason I've come back to update it is because someone asked, lol. To my surprise even after 6 months it was still mostly functional.

To those that continue to use this style, thank you. According to this style's page on userstyles.world, this style has been installed over 5,800 times! It warms my heart that so many people have given this style a shot, and even more so to the people that use this style daily.

There are already universal dark theme extensions/dark Google Calendar themes. Why did you make this?

Originally that was my first method. However, while these extensions do work, I noticed that these extensions/styles have a really ugly glow to them due to simply inverting most of the page. I didn't like the look of it and wanted something that better suited my tastes. Coincidentally I had recently taken a beginner level class on web development, and I figured I could try my hand at custom CSS and make this and share it for free for the lolz.

The future of this style

The CSS for this style is VERY primitive. Like noob level CSS writing. It's nearly pure CSS since that's what I learned in school, no fancy pre-processing that would probably make the code a lot better and more sustainable. (It does use a little bit of Stylus, but not really in a way that would make it better) So, what that means is every time Google makes changes to Calendar there's a good chance things will break and I will manually have to fix it. If and when Google decides to completely redesign calendar this style will be totally broken. Again, the reason it's taken so long is because I haven't been using Calendar and it's tedious to fix things since I'm a noob. I can't guarantee I'll work on this more often. Soooo........

If you are an experienced developer for CSS and like this style, I encourage you to fork it and make it better!
